My opinionated version of the cool concept presented by the youtuber [Kenadian the Catboy](https://www.youtube.com/@kenadianthecatboy). A block that adds a transportation system based on the concept that the End dimension is a _teleporty_ dimension.


The main changes involve using a netherite ingot instead of a compass for crafting and employing a right-click action with a lodestone-charged compass for loading. Apart from these alterations, the mod operates similarly to the concept outlined in the video.

The block textures are sourced from Kenadian's server.

**EDIT**: If you wanna take a look at the original experience from the video without alterations, check out the version developed by [xyzeva on GitHub](https://github.com/xyzeva/ender-relay/tree/main)
